# Introduction

[[An Introduction to the guides]]

## Getting Started

If you are reading this from localhost, you probably already have everything set up, and you can skip directly to one of the scenarios.

Otherwise, see the [Spyderbat eval repository](https://github.com/spyderbat/eval) for detailed setup instructions.

## Format

Each sample guide will provide you all the instructions necessary to run a sample attack scenario, track the events with Spyderbat, and investigate the results in the Spyderbat Console.

Guides will begin with a pre-requisites section describing what policies or resources to create in the Spyderbat UI to properly trace the attack. Next, step-by-step instructions will detail how to execute the scenario, and how to perform an investigation of the tracked events. A few next steps will then be discussed to give examples of how to mitigate and respond to the attack.
