# Introduction

[[An Introduction to the guides]]

## Getting Started

Select a sample from the sidebar and follow along to get started.

## Format

Each sample guide will provide you all the instructions necessary to run the sample attack, track the events with Spyderbat, and investigate the results in the Spyderbat Console.

Guides will begin with a pre-requisites section describing what policies or resources to create in the Spyderbat UI to properly trace the attack. Next, step-by-step instructions will detail how to execute the attack against the pre-existing vulnerable cluster, and how to perform an investigation of the tracked events. A few next steps will then be discussed to give examples of how to mitigate and respond to the attack.
